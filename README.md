#Make Effective Data Visualization

This is project 6 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, connected to the course DATA VISUALIZATION WITH D3.JS.

### Summary
I represented survival rate among Titanic passengers through a grouped bar chart in Dimple js. 
The key question I asked of the data was whether survival of women or class of passengers
resulted in a hgher survival rate. My chart shows that both these things are true: women survived
more than men, but higher classes survived more than lower classes overall.

### Design
####Initial sketch

####Version 1 of the chart in Dimple js


Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

### Feedback
I collected feedback at all stages
Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
