#Make Effective Data Visualization

This is project 6 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, connected to the course DATA VISUALIZATION WITH D3.JS.

###Summary
I represented survival rate among Titanic passengers through a grouped bar chart in Dimple js. 
I wanted to show whether being a woman or a passenger of higher class resulted in higher survival
rates. My chart shows that both these things are true: women survived more than men, but higher
classes survived more than lower classes overall.

###Data Selection and Exploration
My visualization draws from project 2 of my Data Analyst Nanodegree:
[Investigate the Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/robertozanchi/titanic-data), also presented
in ```titanic_analysis.html```. The iPython Notebook and raw data are included in the Github repository.
